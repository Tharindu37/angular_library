ng generate library my-lib
```

Build, test, and lint the project with CLI commands
```

```

Publishing your library

```
```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { MyLibComponent } from 'my-lib'; // Adjust this if using a local version

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [MyLibComponent], // Import the standalone component
  template: `
    <h1>My Application</h1>
    <lib-my-lib message="This is a success message!" type="success"></lib-my-lib>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {}
